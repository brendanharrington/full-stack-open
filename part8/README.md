# Full Stack Open â€” Part 8

This directory contains my solutions for **Part 8** of the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course by the University of Helsinki.  
Part 8 focuses on **GraphQL**, exploring how to build and connect GraphQL backends and frontends using modern tools like Apollo Server and Apollo Client.  
The exercises demonstrate designing schemas, writing queries and mutations, implementing authentication, handling subscriptions, and managing state with GraphQL in React applications.

**Concepts practiced:**  

- Using **Apollo Client** to query and mutate GraphQL data  
- Managing local and remote state in React with Apollo  
- Implementing **authentication** and conditional rendering based on user state  
- Handling **real-time updates** with GraphQL subscriptions  
- Using React hooks (`useQuery`, `useMutation`, `useSubscription`)  
- Structuring large-scale React apps for clarity and reusability
