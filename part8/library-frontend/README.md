## Overview  

This repository contains my solutions for **Full Stack Open – Part 8: GraphQL**, frontend exercises **8.17–8.26**.  
The frontend is a React application using **Apollo Client** to communicate with the GraphQL backend. It includes queries, mutations, authentication, and real-time updates.  

## Exercises 8.17–8.21: Apollo Client Setup  

- Integrated **Apollo Client** for fetching and mutating GraphQL data.  
- Created views to display authors, books, and forms for adding new books.  

## Exercises 8.22–8.25: Authentication and State Management  

- Implemented **login** and **logout** functionality with token-based authentication.  
- Managed authentication state and used Apollo’s cache for efficient data updates.  

## Exercise 8.26: Real-Time Updates  

- Subscribed to new book additions using **useSubscription**.  
- Updated the UI automatically when new data was published to the server.
