## Overview  

This repository contains my solutions for **Full Stack Open – Part 8: GraphQL**, backend exercises **8.1–8.16**.  
The backend is built with **Apollo Server** and **MongoDB**, focusing on GraphQL schema design, resolvers, authentication, and real-time data with subscriptions.  

## Exercises 8.1–8.6: GraphQL Schema and Resolvers  

- Defined **GraphQL types**, queries, and mutations.  
- Implemented resolvers to interact with MongoDB using **Mongoose**.  
- Created relationships between **authors** and **books**.  

## Exercises 8.7–8.12: Authentication  

- Implemented **JWT-based authentication** for user login.  
- Added authorization logic to protect restricted mutations.  
- Injected user information into the GraphQL context for access control.  

## Exercises 8.13–8.16: Subscriptions  

- Configured **GraphQL subscriptions** via WebSockets.  
- Enabled real-time updates to clients when new books are added.
