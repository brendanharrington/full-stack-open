# Full Stack Open â€” Part 1

This directory contains my solutions for **Part 1** of the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course by the University of Helsinki.  
Part 1 focuses on the basics of React, including components, state, and event handling.

## course-information
Introduces React component structure and passing data through props. The exercises build a simple course information display that demonstrates how to break down a UI into reusable components.

## unicafe
Focuses on managing state and handling user interactions. The project simulates a feedback system that collects and displays statistics, emphasizing event handling and conditional rendering.

## anecdotes
Covers rendering lists, updating state stored in arrays or objects, and adding interactivity. The application displays random anecdotes and allows users to vote, showing how to modify state immutably.
