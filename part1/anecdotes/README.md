# Anecdotes Application  

## Overview  
This repository contains my solutions for **Full Stack Open – Part 1: Introduction to React**, exercises **1.12–1.14**.  
These exercises focus on building an interactive application that displays random programming-related anecdotes, allows users to vote for their favorites, and tracks which anecdote has the most votes.

## Exercises  

### 1.12: Displaying a Random Anecdote  
The goal of this exercise is to create a React application that displays one anecdote at a time. Users can click a button to view a randomly selected anecdote from a predefined list.

**Concepts practiced:**  
- Managing component state with `useState`  
- Handling events to update displayed content  
- Rendering dynamic content based on state  
- Using arrays to store multiple data items  

### 1.13–1.14: Voting and Most-Voted Anecdote  
In these exercises, functionality is added to allow users to vote for anecdotes. The application tracks votes in state and displays both the current anecdote's votes and the anecdote with the highest number of votes.

**Concepts practiced:**  
- Updating state with objects and arrays  
- Computing derived values (most-voted anecdote) from state  
- Component decomposition (`Button`, `Anecdote`, `MostVoted`)  
- Conditional rendering and dynamic content updates
