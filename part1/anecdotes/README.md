# Anecdotes Application  

## Overview  
This repository contains my solutions for **Full Stack Open – Part 1: Introduction to React**, exercises **1.12–1.14**.  
These exercises focus on rendering lists, updating state stored in arrays or objects, and adding interactivity through user-driven actions.

## Exercises  

### 1.12: Rendering Anecdotes  
The initial exercise introduces an application that displays a random anecdote from a predefined list each time the user clicks a button.

**Concepts practiced:**  
- Rendering data from arrays  
- Generating random indices to display dynamic content  
- Handling events to update displayed information  

### 1.13–1.14: Voting and Tracking Favorites  
These exercises extend the application to allow users to vote for anecdotes and display the anecdote with the highest number of votes. Votes are stored in an array and updated immutably to maintain React’s state principles.

**Concepts practiced:**  
- Managing arrays within state using `useState`  
- Updating state immutably  
- Computing and displaying derived state (most-voted anecdote)  
- Conditional rendering based on user input
