# Course Information Application  

## Overview  
This repository contains my solutions for **Full Stack Open – Part 1: Introduction to React**, exercises **1.1–1.5**.  
These exercises introduce the fundamentals of building React applications using components and props by creating a simple course information display.

## Exercises  

### 1.1–1.2: Component Basics  
The goal of these exercises is to divide the UI into multiple React components such as `Header`, `Content`, and `Total`. Data is passed between these components using props to display the course name, parts, and exercise counts.

**Concepts practiced:**  
- Creating functional React components  
- Passing data via props  
- Rendering JSX elements dynamically  
- Understanding component-based architecture  

### 1.3–1.5: Working with Data Structures  
These exercises expand the application to use JavaScript objects and arrays to represent course information. The app dynamically calculates and displays the total number of exercises using array methods.

**Concepts practiced:**  
- Using arrays and objects to manage data  
- Rendering multiple components using the `map()` function  
- Calculating derived values from arrays  
- Improving code readability and modularity
