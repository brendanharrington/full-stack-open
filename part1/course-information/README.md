# Course Information Application  

## Overview  
This repository contains my solutions for **Full Stack Open – Part 1: Introduction to React**, exercises **1.1–1.5**.  
These exercises introduce the fundamentals of building user interfaces with React, using components, props, and data structures to render dynamic content.

## Exercises  

### 1.1–1.2: Course Information  
The goal of these exercises is to create a simple React application that displays information about a course, including its name, parts, and the number of exercises for each part.  

**Concepts practiced:**  
- Creating React components  
- Using JSX syntax  
- Passing data via props  
- Rendering dynamic data in the browser  

### 1.3–1.5: Course Information – Refactoring  
In these exercises, the application is refactored into smaller, reusable components (`Header`, `Content`, `Part`, and `Total`).  
The course data is organized into JavaScript objects and arrays, and the components are updated to render dynamically from that data.  

**Concepts practiced:**  
- Component decomposition  
- Rendering lists  
- Using objects and arrays to manage data  
- Understanding component hierarchy and data flow
