# Unicafe Feedback Application  

## Overview  
This repository contains my solutions for **Full Stack Open – Part 1: Introduction to React**, exercises **1.6–1.11**.  
These exercises focus on building an interactive feedback application using React components and state management with the `useState` hook.

## Exercises  

### 1.6–1.8: Collecting Feedback  
The goal of these exercises is to create an application that collects feedback from users in three categories: **good**, **neutral**, and **bad**. The app updates counts dynamically as users interact with the buttons.

**Concepts practiced:**  
- Handling events in React  
- Managing component state with `useState`  
- Passing event handlers as props  
- Rendering dynamic data based on state  

### 1.9–1.11: Displaying Statistics  
In these exercises, the application is expanded to display statistics about the collected feedback, including total feedback count, average score, and percentage of positive feedback. The layout is refactored into smaller reusable components such as `Button`, `Statistics`, and `StatisticLine`.

**Concepts practiced:**  
- Conditional rendering  
- Component decomposition  
- Computing derived state values  
- Structuring a React app into reusable and modular components
