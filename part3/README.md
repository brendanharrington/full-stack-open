# Full Stack Open â€” Part 3  

This directory contains my solutions for **Part 3** of the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course by the University of Helsinki.  
Part 3 focuses on building a backend for a full stack application using **Node.js** and **Express**, as well as deploying the application to an online environment.

## phonebook-backend  
Implements the backend for the Phonebook application created in Part 2. The server handles HTTP requests for creating, reading, updating, and deleting contact data, while connecting to a MongoDB database for persistence.

**Concepts practiced:**  
- Setting up an Express server and defining API routes  
- Handling HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE  
- Using **MongoDB** and **Mongoose** for database integration  
- Implementing middleware for error handling, logging, and serving static files  
- Managing environment variables and configuration  
- Deploying the application to an online hosting platform (such as Render or Fly.io)
