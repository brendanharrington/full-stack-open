# Countries Application  

## Overview  
This repository contains my solutions for **Full Stack Open – Part 2: Communicating with Server**, exercises **2.18–2.20**.  
These exercises focus on building an application that retrieves and displays country data from an external API and manages conditional rendering based on user interaction.

## Exercises  

### 2.18–2.19: Filtering Countries  
The application fetches data from the [REST Countries API](https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/restcountries/) and allows users to search for countries by name. When only one country matches the search, detailed information is displayed, including the country's capital, area, languages, and flag.

**Concepts practiced:**  
- Using the `useEffect` hook for data fetching  
- Managing side effects in React  
- Conditional rendering based on filtered results  
- Handling asynchronous operations  

### 2.20: Adding Weather Data  
This exercise enhances the application by displaying current weather information for the selected country using an external weather API. It demonstrates how to combine data from multiple sources and render it dynamically.

**Concepts practiced:**  
- Integrating multiple external APIs  
- Managing multiple data sources in state  
- Rendering nested asynchronous data  
- Creating a responsive and data-driven UI
