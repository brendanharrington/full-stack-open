# Phonebook Application  

## Overview  
This repository contains my solutions for **Full Stack Open – Part 2: Communicating with Server**, exercises **2.6–2.17**.  
These exercises focus on building a phonebook application that allows users to manage contact information within the frontend using React state.

**Concepts practiced:**  
- Conditional rendering and user feedback messages  
- Component decomposition for cleaner architecture  
- Updating and deleting items immutably  
- Maintaining consistent and predictable state management
