# Full Stack Open â€” Part 2

This directory contains my solutions for **Part 2** of the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course by the University of Helsinki.  
Part 2 expands on the fundamentals of React by introducing data fetching, modular component design, and state management across multiple components.

## course-information
Extends the Part 1 Course Information application to support multiple courses and nested data structures. This section focuses on rendering dynamic lists and organizing React components into a clear hierarchy.

## phonebook
Implements a contact management application that allows users to add, update, filter, and delete contacts. Data is managed within the frontend using React state, and the app demonstrates controlled form inputs and conditional rendering.

## countries
Creates a country information viewer that retrieves and displays data from an external API. The app allows users to search for countries, view details like languages and flags, and display weather information for the selected country.
