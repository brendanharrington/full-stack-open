# Course Information Application  

## Overview  
This repository contains my solutions for **Full Stack Open – Part 2: Communicating with Server**, exercises **2.1–2.5**.  
These exercises extend the Part 1 Course Information app to handle more complex data structures and render multiple courses dynamically.

## Exercises  

### 2.1–2.3: Rendering Multiple Courses  
The goal of these exercises is to modify the application to display multiple courses using arrays of objects. Each course includes a name, a list of parts, and the number of exercises per part.

**Concepts practiced:**  
- Rendering nested data structures with the `map()` function  
- Passing complex props between components  
- Breaking down large components into smaller reusable ones  

### 2.4–2.5: Calculating Totals  
These exercises introduce the use of array methods such as `reduce()` to compute total exercises for each course dynamically. The app demonstrates clean separation of logic and presentation across components.

**Concepts practiced:**  
- Computing derived values using `reduce()`  
- Managing component hierarchy and prop flow  
- Structuring applications for clarity and scalability
