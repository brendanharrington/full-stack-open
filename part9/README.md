# Full Stack Open – Part 9: TypeScript  

## Overview

This directory contains my solutions for **Full Stack Open – Part 9**, which introduces **TypeScript** through a series of progressively complex projects.  
The exercises cover TypeScript fundamentals, static type checking, type-safe backend development with **Express**, and type-safe frontend development with **React**.  
The part is divided into several subprojects: **TypeScript Utilities**, **Patientor**, **Flight Diaries**, and **React Exercises**, each focusing on specific applications of TypeScript.  

## Projects  

### 1. TypeScript Utilities and Express API (Exercises 9.1–9.7)  

A collection of command-line and web-based utilities built using TypeScript.  
These exercises introduce type safety, command-line parsing, and Express API creation with properly typed endpoints.  

**Key Concepts:**  

- TypeScript syntax, interfaces, and enums  
- Command-line argument parsing  
- Express with TypeScript  
- ESLint configuration and static analysis  

**Directory:** `first-steps`  

### 2. Patientor Backend and Frontend (Exercises 9.8–9.14, 9.21–9.30)  

A TypeScript-based backend for a pre-built healthcare management frontend.  
The backend handles patients, diagnoses, and health entries, while the frontend integrates type-safe data fetching, rendering, and form validation.  

**Key Concepts:**  

- Backend type safety with TypeScript and Express  
- Zod schema validation  
- Shared types between backend and frontend  
- Discriminated unions for complex data modeling  
- Type-safe React components and forms  

**Directory:** `patientor`  

### 3. Flight Diaries (Exercises 9.17–9.20)  

A full-stack application for recording flight diary entries.  
The project involves building a React frontend that communicates with a TypeScript backend, focusing on type-safe data fetching, form handling, and error management.  

**Key Concepts:**  

- Axios with TypeScript  
- Form validation and error handling  
- Union types for structured backend data  
- Strongly typed React state and props  

**Directory:** `flight-diaries`  

### 4. React TypeScript Exercises (Exercises 9.15–9.16)  

Refactoring a React application originally written in JavaScript to fully typed TypeScript components.  
The project emphasizes strong typing for props, component interfaces, and discriminated unions for rendering different course parts.  

**Key Concepts:**  

- TypeScript with React components  
- Component props typing and interfaces  
- Discriminated union and exhaustive type checking  
- Clean architecture with modular components  

**Directory:** `react-exercises`  

## Summary  

Part 9 of **Full Stack Open** highlights the benefits of **TypeScript** for improving reliability, maintainability, and developer productivity across both frontend and backend applications.  
Through these exercises, strong typing, static analysis, and validation techniques are applied to build robust, type-safe full-stack systems.
