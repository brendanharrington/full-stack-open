# flight-diaries

## Overview  

This repository contains my solutions for **Full Stack Open – Part 9: TypeScript**, exercises **9.17–9.20**.  
These exercises build a frontend for the **Flight Diaries** application, where users can view and add flight diary entries while maintaining strong typing across API calls, form inputs, and state management.  

## Exercises  

### 9.17: Fetch and Display Diaries

- Create a new TypeScript React app.  
- Fetch existing flight diaries from the backend and render them on screen.  
- Define proper types for diary entries and ensure there are no ESLint warnings.  

**Concepts practiced:**  

- Fetching and typing API data  
- Rendering lists with type-safe components  
- Maintaining clean TypeScript configurations  

### 9.18: Add New Diary Entries  

- Implement a form for adding new diary entries to the backend.  
- Use controlled components for handling user input.  

**Concepts practiced:**  

- Managing state with `useState`  
- Posting typed data to an API  
- Updating local state after successful submission  

### 9.19: Error Handling  

- Display error messages when diary creation fails (e.g., invalid input).  
- Extract and display backend error responses using Axios error narrowing.  

**Concepts practiced:**  

- Typed error handling with Axios  
- User notifications and conditional rendering  

### 9.20: Typed and Validated Input  

- Replace free-text inputs with proper HTML elements (date picker, radio buttons).  
- Keep all fields strongly typed while preventing invalid input.  

**Concepts practiced:**  

- Form validation with HTML and TypeScript  
- Type-safe radio button groups  
- Improving UX with stricter input handling
