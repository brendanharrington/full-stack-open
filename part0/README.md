# Part 0 – Fundamentals of Web Apps

This part introduces the fundamentals of how web applications work — including the relationship between browsers, servers, and client-side scripts.

## Exercises 0.4-0.6

These exercises explore the request–response cycle and how single-page applications (SPAs) function using **sequence diagrams**.

### 0.4: New Note Diagram
Depicts what happens when a user creates a new note using the classic version of the Notes app at [`https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/notes`](https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/notes).

### 0.5: Single Page App Diagram
Shows what happens when the user opens the SPA version of the Notes app at [`https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/spa`](https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/spa).

### 0.6: New Note in Single Page App Diagram
Illustrates how a new note is created and sent asynchronously to the server in the SPA version, with the page updating dynamically.
